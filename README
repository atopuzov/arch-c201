This is just assorted stuff i have for having a more usable system on _my_ C201 w/ arch...

# for 3.14
if you want to run that, copy the ROCKCHIPI2S alsa ucm
data from ChromeOS and adjust alsaucm-setup.service accordingly

# 4.16
for blobby wifi: copy the brcm firmware incl. the .txt from ChromeOS, namely these files:
/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4354-sdio.bin 
/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4354-sdio.txt
(linux-firmware had a different bin, but i decided to trust ChromeOS instead...)
