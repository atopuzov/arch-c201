Short guide to my patches

0020: Allows HDMI to work properly, likely not mainlineable (atleast as-is)
	but i can live in hope...
	seperate commits at: https://github.com/urjaman/linux/tree/rk3288_chromebook_hdmi_v3
0022: 100% hack, but should be harmless on veyrons and allows you to use the usb port 
	w/ an otg controller as a device
0023: Runs the panel actually at ~60Hz, dunno how useful but eases my mind.
	The bigger thing is that the clock rate shown in xrandr matches
	what the panel is ran at so that any apps doing frame timing math should
	work better.
0024: Enables dithering for the 6-bit per channel panel, fixes banding.
0025: Implements the gamma LUT so things like redshift "work", this is
      still a bit WIP (flickers) since the hardware is really f'ed up in making
      it really hard (= almost impossible? that is to be determined)
      to change from one gamma table to another without a frame
      with the gamma off in between them.
0026: Fixes sound output in 4.19... (a small-diff revert while we wait for proper fix)
0027: Slightly adjust the device tree entry for the GPU so that ARM mali kernel module loads and finds it
	(this is otherwise entirely untested stuff, just for debugging it)
