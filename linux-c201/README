Short guide to my patches

0020: Allows HDMI to work properly, likely not mainlineable (atleast as-is)
	but i can live in hope...
	seperate commits at: https://github.com/urjaman/linux/tree/rk3288_chromebook_hdmi_v3
0021: Fixes USB hotplug, a version of this by someone else should soon
	be in mainline and i can remove this
0022: 100% hack, but should be harmless on veyrons and allows you to use the usb port 
	w/ an otg controller as a device
0023: Runs the panel actually at ~60Hz, dunno how useful but eases my mind.
	The bigger thing is that the clock rate shown in xrandr matches
	what the panel is ran at so that any apps doing frame timing math should
	work better.
0024: Enables dithering for the 6-bit per channel panel, fixes banding.
